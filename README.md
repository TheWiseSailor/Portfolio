# Portfolio Page
Welcome to my portfolio page! This Project showcases my skills and talents to potential employers. I have deployed a couple of applications, which are live on the web and available for review. As a student of this bootcamp, I understand the importance of having several deployed projects as a minimum requirement to recieve an initial interview at many companies.

# User Story 
As an employer I want to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br>
WHEN I load their portfolio<br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact<br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport<br>
