          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I was adopted from China in 2006, and brought to the US where as of
            now, I still live. I grew up near Shelby N.C. to which is not a busy
            place, but rather a quiet peaceful place. I enjoy working out and
            eating a horrible diet, to which I will soon change. Recently I have
            discovered a passion for coding; I love computers and how they work.
            I aspire to be either a freelancer in Fullstack Development, or a
            contributing partner for either Google, Apple, or Linked-In.
