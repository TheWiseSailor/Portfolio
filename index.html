          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I was adopted from China in 2006 and brought to the US, where I
            still live. I grew up near Shelby, N.C., which is not a busy place
            but rather a quiet and peaceful place. I enjoy working out and
            eating a poor diet, which I plan to change soon. I have recently
            discovered a passion for coding; I love computers and how they work.
            My aspiration is to become either a freelancer in Fullstack
            Development or a contributing partner for Google, Apple, or
            LinkedIn.

        <section id="My Experience">
          <h2>My Experience</h2>
          <p>
            In 2020, I decided to try and get a grasp of coding. I started
            watching a bunch of YouTube Coding Crash Courses, made a small
            project, but ultimately decided to take a break and finish my high
            school career. By the end of 2022, I had obtained my A.S. Degree and
            decided to pursue a job within the programming field. At the
            beginning of this year, I decided to be a part of an online
            fullstack bootcamp at UNC Charlotte. I knew that both of my cousins
            were in the field of IT, and they had a positive outlook on the
            field. They recommended that I take this bootcamp.

        <section id="My Skills">
          <h2>Skills</h2>
          I have taken a Python Course at my local Community College.
          <p></p>
          I have had relative prior experience to Html and CSS, before taking
          this bootcamp.
